				Trash Magic is a game of quests, networking people and resources for mutual aid.
				<br>
				<br>				
Trash Magic is: (1) good for the community, (2) made for free, and (3) holds instructions to (a) copy, (b) change, and (c) recycle itself
					<br>
					<br>
	(1) GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY:
					<br>
	If a helpful thing can be copied sustainably without exploitation, or if it is accessible, sustainable, and useful for the community at large, then it is good for the community.
					<br>
					<br>
	(2) MADE FOR FREE:
					<br>
	Ideally, the thing is upcycled from used materials. If it is sustainably sourced from nature, this is okay too. It's even normal to spend a little money to get basic tools. But nothing should be used if it is extremely expensive or if the item itself is too rare to be found by others trying to replicate the thing. There are so many second-hand materials floating around that our goal is to create the blueprints for a society that costs no money to build and maintain. Trash Magic consumes capitalism like fungus consumes a log. More free stuff makes it easier for others to make free stuff out of free stuff. We are scaling this system at a negative marginal cost.
					<br>
					<br>
	(3) HOLDS INSTRUCTIONS:
					<br>
	Everything we make should be easy to use and copy. The copying instructions themselves or a hyperlink to them should be physically connected to the thing itself (written on it, engraved, etc.). The instructions should be easy to find and understand. The blueprints and assembly should make the thing easy to modify and adapt to new situations and needs. It should also contain information on how it can be taken apart without destroying it and how the individual parts can be reused in new projects.

				Your first quest is to replicate the Trash Magic Trilogy and upload it to archive.org and github.com, as well as any other online or offline databases or hosting pages you use. You can download these books by clicking the buttons below. Please use the tags TRASH MAGIC, SELF-REPLICATING GEOMETRY, and UPCYCLING when you do so.
				<br>
				<br>
				Your second quest is to create your own set of online documents just like this one, which can be accessed by anyone online at https://[your_username].github.io. You can replicate any blueprint(s) from this system or the entire system with the buttons below. Then, upload the set of blueprints to your github profile under a repository called [your_username]. Upload a copy also to archive.org, etc.
				<br>
				<br>
				Your third quest is to make physical hyperlinks (called hyperseeds) by writing your github.io url on cardboard or other waste items, along with the words TRASH MAGIC, a drawing of a golden pentagram or unicursal hexagram, and a QR code which also points to your url. Then give these to others or leave them to be found. Make them beautiful. All Trash Magic is art!
				<br>
				<br>
				Your next quests are entirely up to you! Take a look at the <a>blueprint library</a> for ideas.
